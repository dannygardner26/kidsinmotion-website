# Kids in Motion - Production Completion Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan to complete the Kids in Motion website and make it fully production-ready. The current system has a solid foundation with Spring Boot backend and React frontend, but requires significant completion work.

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Authentication Integration Gap
**Problem:** Frontend uses Firebase Auth, backend expects JWT tokens
**Status:** ðŸ”´ Critical

**Solution:**
- Create Firebase Admin SDK integration in backend
- Implement Firebase token validation filter
- Replace JWT implementation with Firebase token verification
- Update all authentication flows

### 2. Missing Backend CRUD Operations
**Problem:** Controllers only have GET endpoints, no CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE
**Status:** ðŸ”´ Critical

**Missing Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/events` - Create events (Admin only)
- `PUT /api/events/{id}` - Update events (Admin only)
- `DELETE /api/events/{id}` - Delete events (Admin only)
- `POST /api/participants` - Register for events
- `DELETE /api/participants/{id}` - Cancel registration
- `POST /api/volunteers` - Volunteer signup
- `DELETE /api/volunteers/{id}` - Cancel volunteer signup

### 3. Database Configuration
**Problem:** Using H2 in-memory database (data lost on restart)
**Status:** ðŸ”´ Critical

**Solution:**
- Configure PostgreSQL for production
- Add database migration scripts (Flyway/Liquibase)
- Environment-specific database configs
- Connection pooling configuration
